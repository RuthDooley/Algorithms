# Introduction
The contents of this github file is that of the 2nd Year "Algorithms" (COMP20290) module practical development and assignments. The individual breakdown and description of the assignments can be found below. 

# Development
Practical Number | Practical Source | Description | Write Up
---------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | --------
1 | [Algorithm Analysis](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/wk2-algorithm-analysis)| ThreeSumA and ThreeSumB are both methods that find if a trio of numbers in a given array sums to a given integer. The performance of each algorithm was calculated and is compared in the write up. | [Algorithm Analysis Write Up](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/blob/main/wk2-algorithm-analysis/Algorithms%20-%20Practical%201%20Answers.pdf)
2 | [Complexity Analysis](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/wk3-complexity-analysis) | The Russian Peasants Algorithgm is a variation of multiplication. It finds the multiple of two numbers using a halving and doubling technique. Again two algorithms were used and compared in the performance write up. | [Complexity Analysis Write Up](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/blob/main/wk3-complexity-analysis/Algorithms%20-%20Practical%202%20Answers%20.pdf)
3 | [Recursion](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/wk4-recursion/src) | This weeks practical was all about recursion. To display this, I developed a fibonacci sequence aglorithm. This was also implemented an iterative way and the performnace of the two was compared in the write up.| [Recursion Write Up](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/blob/main/wk4-recursion/Algorithms%20Practical%203%20-%20Ruth%20Dooley%2019300753%20Answers.pdf)
4 | [Sorting](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/wk5-sorting/src) | The efficiency of three sorting algorithms were being tested. Insertion, Selection and Bogo sort were used to demonstrate the value of sorting and their speeds were compared against each other in the write up. | [Sorting Write Up](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/blob/main/wk5-sorting/Algorithms%20Practical%204%20-%20Ruth%20Dooley%2019300753%20-%20Answers.pdf)
5 | [Advanced Sorting](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/wk6-advanced-sorting/src) | In this weeks practical insertion sort was compared against merge sort. In addition to this I implemented an enhanced sort algorithm and compared its performance aginst the two. | NA
6 | [QuickSort](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/wk7-quicksort/src) | To continue with sorting, quick sort was compared against insertion sort. In addition to this I implemented an enhanced quick sort algorithm and compared its performance against the others. | NA
7 | [Substring Search](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/wk8-substring-search/src) | The idea of a substring searchg is to identify if a given string appears in a given text. In this instance I implemented a brute force method as well as the more popular algorithm KnuthMorrisPratt. | NA
8 | [Trie](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/wk9-trie/src) | This week we implemented a trie algorithm. We traverse the nodes of a tree like data structure in a way that each node represented a letter and the linked nodes represented a word. As well as implementing this algorithm, we weere required to figure out by hand some sample tries. | [Trie Write Up](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/blob/main/wk9-trie/Practical%208%20Solutions.pdf)
9 | [Run Length](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/wk10-run-length/src) | RLE or run length encoding, is a form of lossless data compression. In this weeks practical we assessed the performance of various types of source files| NA
A1 | [Huffman Tree Compression](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/tree/main/ass-huffaman-compression/src) | Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. In this algorithm, a variable-length code is assigned to input different characters. The code length is related to how frequently characters are used. For this assignment I implemented this code of compression and decompression and analised the resulsts. | [Huffman Tree Compression Write Up](https://github.com/CompAlgorithms/algorithms20290-2021-repository-RuthDooley/blob/main/ass-huffaman-compression/HuffmanAlgorithmAnswers.pdf)
